Description
-----------

An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern
microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of
Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance
optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined
instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that
memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred
may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the
microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed
instructions that never actually commit (retire).

Impact
------

As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read
privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.

Mitigation
----------

None
