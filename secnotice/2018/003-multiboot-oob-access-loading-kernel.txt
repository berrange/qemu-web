        QEMU Security Notice: QSN-2018-003
        ==================================

       Summary: Multiboot out of bounds loading kernel
   Reported on: 20180221
  Published on: 20180227
      Fixed on: 20180328

      See also: CVE-2018-7550

Description
-----------

Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with the PC System Emulator with
multiboot feature support is vulnerable to an OOB memory access
issue. It could occur while loading a kernel image during a guest
boot if multiboot head addresses mh_load_end_addr was greater than
mh_bss_end_addr.

Impact
------

A user/process could use this flaw to potentially achieve arbitrary
code execution on a host.

Mitigation
----------

Do not use the -kernel argument to QEMU for providing the boot
kernel. Allow the guest firmware and bootloader (eg grub) to load
the boot kernel from inside the confined guest execution environment
