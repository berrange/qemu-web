Description
-----------

The QEMU Guest Agent in QEMU is vulnerable to an integer overflow in
the qmp_guest_file_read(). An attacker could exploit this by sending
a crafted QMP command (including guest-file-read with a large count
value) to the agent via the listening socket to trigger a g_malloc()
call with a large memory chunk resulting in a segmentation fault.

Impact
------

A user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU guest agent process
resulting in DoS.

Mitigation
----------

Disable the QEMU guest agent
