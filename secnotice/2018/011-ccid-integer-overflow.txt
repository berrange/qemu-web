Description
-----------

An integer overflow issue was found in the CCID Passthru card device
emulation, while reading card data in ccid_card_vscard_read()
function. The ccid_card_vscard_read() function accepts a signed
integer 'size' argument, which is subsequently used as unsigned
size_t value in memcpy(), copying large amounts of memory.

Impact
------

A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.

Mitigation
----------

Remove the CCID device emulation from virtual machines
